# TestSuits — Modern Test Management System

A self-hosted test management platform for manual functional QA. Organise projects, run test suites, track executions, link defects to Jira, and store evidence in MinIO — a lightweight, Docker-Compose alternative to TestRail / Zephyr / qTest.

- **Multi-tenant** — every object is scoped to a Company; cross-tenant access is blocked at the API layer.
- **Jira integration** — Jira credentials are configured once per company; each project picks which Jira project to file bugs into. `Create Jira bug` on a failed execution only enables when the execution's project has a Jira binding and the company has Jira credentials saved.
- **Custom fields** — per-project configurable fields (text, long text, number, select, checkbox) that attach to every test case in the project.
- **Shared / reusable steps** — a per-project library of named steps; insert one into any case from the step editor.
- **Rich-text editor** — WYSIWYG (TipTap) with a toolbar (bold, italic, inline code, bullet/numbered lists, links, undo/redo) on the fields where formatting actually helps forensic detail: step action/expected, preconditions, shared-step library entries, and — on execution detail — *Actual result* and *Why it failed*. Stored and rendered as Markdown, so plain-text content round-trips and existing rows stay readable. Link URLs are restricted to `http(s)`/`mailto`/`tel` — `javascript:` and other schemes are blocked at both insert and render time.
- **Webhooks** — configure outbound HTTP webhooks per project on events (`run.created`, `run.completed`, `run.archived`, `execution.failed`, `execution.passed`, `jira.bug_created`). Optional HMAC-SHA256 signing, delivery log, test-fire button.
- **Kanban run view** — toggle between list and kanban on the Runs page; managers drag cards between columns to change a run's status.
- **Archive runs** — managers can archive a test run to remove it from the active list. An **Archived** tab on the Runs page shows all archived runs; managers can restore them back to active.
- **Evidence storage** — upload screenshots, videos and logs against cases or executions.
- **Full activity log** — per-project event stream with filters.
- **CSV export** of run results.
- **API tokens** — personal access tokens (`ts_…` prefix, SHA-256 hashed at rest). Send as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to call the API from CI. Token auth is read-only on the token management endpoints — tokens can't mint more tokens.
- **Email verification** — new signups must verify their email address before signing in. A tokenized verification link (24 h TTL) is emailed on signup; the UI shows the link in dev mode. Invited, SAML, and SCIM-provisioned users are auto-verified.
- **Two-factor authentication (TOTP)** — optional per-user 2FA. Users enable it from their Profile page (scan QR code with any TOTP app). When enabled, login requires a 6-digit code after the password step. A **Trust this device** checkbox lets users skip 2FA on the same browser for 30 days. Disabling 2FA requires the current password and revokes all trusted devices.
- **Remember me** — unchecked (default) sessions expire in 24 hours; checked sessions last 30 days. The choice carries through the 2FA step so the full flow honours it.
- **Invite flow & password reset** — managers invite teammates via one-time signed links; users reset their own password from the sign-in page. Links go through SMTP (Mailpit in dev, any SMTP provider in prod), and the UI also surfaces a copyable dev link for local testing.
- **Requirements & traceability** — first-class `Requirement` objects per project, with many-to-many links to test cases. The Coverage Matrix has a **Requirement** dimension that pivots the latest execution status per case under each linked requirement; unlinked cells are blank and linked-but-never-executed cells show `UNTESTED`.
- **User locking** — managers can lock any user from the Team page. Locked users cannot sign in, use the app, or call the API (JWT and API-token requests return `423`). Unlock to restore access.
- **Roles** — `ADMIN` (company settings, SSO/SCIM tokens, audit log), `MANAGER` (all project work), `TESTER` (runs/executions they own, created, or are assigned to; can execute and assign), `VIEWER` (read-only across the company).
- **SCIM 2.0 user provisioning** — working. Issue a per-tenant SCIM token from Company Settings → SSO, point your IdP (Okta, Azure AD, JumpCloud) at `/api/scim/v2`. Groups and role-to-group mapping are not yet supported.
- **SAML SSO — scaffolding only, not production-ready.** The per-company config UI and routes are in place, but `/saml/:slug/login` returns `501` and `/saml/:slug/acs` deliberately rejects requests until a real assertion parser is wired up (see comments in `backend/src/routes/saml.ts` for the exact steps — install `@node-saml/node-saml` and verify against `cfg.x509Cert`). Do not expose these routes to the public internet as-is.
- **Audit log** — `/api/audit` surfaces the tenant-wide activity stream with user/action/date filters and CSV export for compliance reviews.
- **Test case versioning** — every `PATCH /cases/:id` snapshots the prior state to `TestCaseRevision` and `GET /cases/:id/revisions` returns the full audit trail. The case detail page exposes a History panel that lists revisions with author/date/changed-field summary; a per-version field-level diff view is on the roadmap.
- **Executive dashboard** — stat tiles, 30-day execution & pass-rate trend, release-readiness per milestone, defect aging buckets, top failing cases.
- **i18n** — English and French built in with a language switcher; sidebar collapses for more canvas. All API error, warning, and info messages are returned as stable `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` machine keys (e.g. `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`); the frontend translates them via `t('errors.' + key)`. Validation messages, placeholders, and aria-labels are also served from the language files — no hardcoded English in `.tsx` files or API responses.
- **Dark mode** — light by default. Toggle in the sidebar; the choice is saved in `localStorage` and applied pre-hydration so there's no flash on refresh. Toasts and the TipTap editor follow the theme automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Docker 24+ with Docker Compose v2
- That's it — everything else runs inside containers.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/testsuits.git
cd testsuits
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

On first boot the API container runs `prisma db push` to create the schema and `prisma db seed` to insert the generic demo data. Open:

| Service        | URL                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web UI         | http://localhost:5173                       |
| API            | http://localhost:4000/api                   |
| MinIO console  | http://localhost:9005 (minioadmin/minioadmin) |
| Mailpit (mail) | http://localhost:8025                       |
| Postgres       | localhost:5434 (user/pass: `testsuits`)     |

### Seeded accounts

The seed creates two isolated tenants so you can verify cross-company isolation immediately:

| Tenant                    | Email                         | Password   | Role    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Acme QA (primary demo)    | `manager@acme.local`          | `acme123`  | MANAGER |
| Acme QA                   | `tester@acme.local`           | `acme123`  | TESTER  |
| Globex QA (isolation test)| `manager@globex.local`        | `globex123`| MANAGER |
| Globex QA                 | `tester@globex.local`         | `globex123`| TESTER  |

The Acme tenant ships with two projects:

- **Acme Checkout** — 3 suites (Cart, Payment, Shipping), 10 cases, 2 milestones, 4 runs covering smoke / full regression / offline / localisation, a failing execution linked to a sample Jira key, comments, activity-log entries, API token, and attachment metadata.
- **Acme Customer Portal** — 2 suites (Account, Orders), 5 cases, 1 milestone, 1 smoke run with a failing profile-update execution.

The Globex tenant has a single project (`BILLING`) with a small run so the isolation test is still useful: log in as a Globex user and confirm you can't see Acme's data, then check that Globex's own project still renders on every page.

## Configuration

All runtime configuration is controlled by `.env`. Copy `.env.example` and tweak as needed.

### Required

| Variable           | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_USER`    | Postgres superuser (created on first boot)                |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`| Postgres password                                         |
| `POSTGRES_DB`      | Database name                                             |
| `DATABASE_URL`     | Prisma connection string (uses the three vars above)      |
| `JWT_SECRET`       | Signing secret for JWTs — **required in production** (API refuses to start with the default/empty value when `NODE_ENV=production`). Generate with `openssl rand -hex 48`. |
| `API_PORT`         | Port the Express API listens on (inside the container)    |
| `WEB_PORT`         | Port the Vite dev server listens on                       |
| `VITE_API_URL`     | URL the **browser** uses to reach the API                 |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of origins allowed to call the API. Leave empty in dev for auto-reflect. **Required in production** — an empty list denies all cross-origin requests. |
| `TRUST_PROXY`      | Number of reverse-proxy hops to trust for `X-Forwarded-For` (e.g. `1` behind a single LB). Without this, per-IP rate limits collapse every request onto the proxy IP. |

### Host port overrides

Change these if the defaults collide with something else on your host:

| Variable                  | Default | Maps to                             |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`      | `5434`  | Postgres `5432` inside the container |
| `MINIO_HOST_PORT`         | `9004`  | MinIO S3 API `9000`                 |
| `MINIO_CONSOLE_HOST_PORT` | `9005`  | MinIO web console `9001`            |

### Object storage (MinIO)

| Variable              | Purpose                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MINIO_ROOT_USER`     | MinIO admin user                                                          |
| `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` | MinIO admin password                                                      |
| `MINIO_BUCKET`        | Bucket name (created automatically by the `minio-init` service)           |
| `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`  | URL the **browser** uses for signed downloads (host + `MINIO_HOST_PORT`)  |

### Optional: auto-configure Jira

Set these to have the seed attach a `JiraConfig` to the Acme tenant on first boot. `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`, if present, is bound to the `CHECKOUT` project so the per-project targeting is ready-to-go too. Omit these to configure Jira through the UI instead (Company Settings → Jira, then Project Settings → Jira binding).

```env
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-org.atlassian.net
JIRA_USER=you@example.com
JIRA_TOKEN=your-atlassian-api-token
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=PROJ
```

API tokens: [id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).

### Email

Outgoing email (password reset, team invites) is sent via SMTP. In dev the compose stack ships a [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) container that catches every message — no real mailbox required.

| Variable            | Default                                      | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SMTP_URL`          | `smtp://mailpit:1025`                        | SMTP connection string. Unset = log the body, don't send     |
| `MAIL_FROM`         | `TestSuits <no-reply@testsuits.local>`       | From header on every message                                 |
| `APP_URL`           | `http://localhost:5173`                      | Base URL used to build links (reset, invite) in email bodies |
| `MAILPIT_SMTP_PORT` | `1025`                                       | Host-side SMTP port for Mailpit                              |
| `MAILPIT_UI_PORT`   | `8025`                                       | Host-side web UI for Mailpit                                 |

Open [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) to read every email the app sends. For production, set `SMTP_URL` to your provider's URL (e.g. `smtps://postmaster@mg.example.com:KEY@smtp.mailgun.org:465`) — no code changes needed.

## Working with the app

### Accessing from another device on your LAN

`VITE_API_URL` and `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` are URLs **the browser** resolves. When you open the UI from another machine, replace `localhost` with your host's LAN address, e.g.:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.20:4000/api
S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=http://192.168.1.20:9004
```

Then restart: `docker compose up -d --build web`.

### Re-seeding / resetting

Wipe everything and start from scratch:

```bash
docker compose down -v   # -v removes the postgres-data and minio-data volumes
docker compose up --build
```

Run just the seed against an already-running stack:

```bash
docker compose exec api npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

The seed is idempotent — rows that already exist are skipped.

### Resetting a single tenant's demo

Log in as a manager, delete the project from the UI, then re-run the seed; it will re-create just the missing pieces.

## Configuring Jira from the UI

Jira is split across two screens: credentials + templates live at the **company** level (they're reused by every project in the tenant), and the target Jira project lives on each **project**.

### 1. Company-level credentials (once per tenant)

1. Log in as a manager.
2. Open **Company Settings → Jira**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Base URL** (e.g. `https://acme.atlassian.net`)
   - **Email** (the owner of the API token)
   - **API token** — create at [id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
   - **Default issue type** (default: `Bug`)
   - Optional: summary / description templates used when filing bugs
4. **Test connection** → **Save**.

### 2. Per-project binding (once per project)

1. Open the project → **Settings → Jira**.
2. Pick the **Jira project** to file bugs into (the dropdown lists projects discovered via the company's saved credentials).
3. Optionally override the issue type and pick a parent epic.
4. **Save**.

### 3. Filing bugs

On a failed execution, click **Create Jira bug**. The defect is filed with the full test context (steps, failure reason, tester, environment, run name) and linked back to the execution. The button is only enabled when the company has Jira credentials saved **and** the execution's project has a Jira binding.

## Email verification, invites & password reset

Outbound mail goes through SMTP. In development, the `mailpit` container in `docker-compose.yml` provides a local SMTP sink + web UI — open http://localhost:8025 to read mail sent by the app. In production, point `SMTP_URL` at your real provider (Mailgun, SES, Postmark, etc).

### Signing up (email verification required)

1. Fill in the signup form and submit.
2. The server creates the company and user but does **not** sign you in. Instead, it emails a verification link valid for 24 hours. In dev mode the link is also shown in the UI.
3. Click the verification link. The server marks the email as verified, issues a JWT, and logs you in.
4. Until verified, login is blocked with a "please verify your email" message and a **Resend** button.

Invited users, SAML-authenticated users, and SCIM-provisioned users skip verification — their email ownership is already established.

### Invite a teammate

1. Log in as a manager.
2. Open **Team → Invite teammate**.
3. Fill in name, email, and role, and click **Invite**.
4. The server issues a one-time link valid for 7 days and emails it to the invitee. In dev, the UI also shows the link for easy copy-paste.
5. The invitee opens the link, sets their password, and is signed in directly — no second step, no shared passwords. The account is automatically marked as email-verified.

### Forgot your password?

The sign-in page has a **Forgot your password?** link. Enter your email; if it matches an account, the server issues a one-time link valid for 1 hour and emails it. The response is identical for known and unknown emails (no user enumeration).

## Two-factor authentication (TOTP)

2FA is opt-in per user and disabled by default.

### Enabling 2FA

1. Open **Profile** from the sidebar.
2. In the **Two-factor authentication** section, click **Enable 2FA**.
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.), or enter the manual key.
4. Type the 6-digit code from the app and click **Verify**.
5. 2FA is now active for your account.

### Signing in with 2FA

After entering your email and password, a second screen asks for the 6-digit code from your authenticator app. The challenge token is valid for 5 minutes. Check **Trust this device for 30 days** to skip the code step on future logins from the same browser.

### Trusted devices

When you check "Trust this device" during 2FA, the server issues an opaque token (`td_` prefix, SHA-256 hashed at rest, 30-day expiry). On subsequent logins the token is sent via `X-Trust-Token` header; if it's valid for the authenticated user, the 2FA step is bypassed. Trusted device tokens are revoked automatically when:

- The user changes their password
- The user resets their password
- 2FA is disabled

Logout does **not** revoke trusted devices — the trust represents the machine, not the session. A forced session revocation (401) clears the trust token from the browser.

### Disabling 2FA

In **Profile → Two-factor authentication**, enter your current password and click **Disable 2FA**. All trusted devices are revoked.

### Remember me

The login page has a **Remember me for 30 days** checkbox. When unchecked (default), the JWT session expires in 24 hours. When checked, it lasts 30 days. The flag is carried through the 2FA challenge flow so the session duration is honoured regardless of whether 2FA is enabled.

## API tokens (for CI / scripting)

Open **API tokens** from the sidebar. Create a token, give it a name, and copy the plaintext — the server stores only a SHA-256 hash and the plaintext is shown exactly once. Use it as:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ts_<your-token>" https://testsuits.example.com/api/runs
```

Tokens inherit the creator's role and company. Token-authenticated callers can hit every endpoint **except** the token management endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/tokens`) — those require a JWT session so a compromised token can't mint fresh credentials.

Revoke a token anytime from the same page. Revocation is immediate.

A `CI seed token` is created automatically by the seed for the primary manager; the plaintext is printed to the seed log so you can demo the flow end-to-end.

## Requirements & traceability

Requirements are first-class per-project objects. Open a project → **Requirements** to create them; each one has an external reference (a URL or ID in your requirements system — Jira story, Confluence page, etc) and a title.

Link requirements to cases from **Case → Edit → Linked requirements** (multi-select). The legacy free-text `requirements[]` on a case still works and is shown in a separate panel; use the first-class links for anything that should surface in traceability reporting.

The Coverage Matrix picks up a new dimension: select **Requirement** on the Matrix page and the columns become the project's requirements. Each cell shows the latest non-`PENDING` execution status for the case, limited to the requirements the case is linked to. Cells for unlinked requirements are blank; cells for linked requirements that have never been executed show `UNTESTED`.

## Local development

Docker is the recommended path. If you want to run the services natively (e.g. for faster hot-reload on the backend), point your local Node.js 20 at the Postgres and MinIO containers:

```bash
# One-time
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Backend (reads DATABASE_URL from .env)
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

You can still run just Postgres + MinIO in Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d db minio minio-init
```

### Extending the seed with local fixtures

`prisma/seed.ts` automatically loads `prisma/seed.hapster.ts` if the file is present. That filename is gitignored, as is anything matching `seed.*.local.ts`. Export a default async function:

```ts
// backend/prisma/seed.hapster.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export default async function (prisma: PrismaClient) {
  // create your internal tenant, users, projects, etc.
}
```

Run it:

```bash
docker compose exec api npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

## API surface (high level)

All routes live under `/api`. Authentication is required except the public endpoints called out below. Every authenticated route is scoped to the caller's company; cross-tenant reads return 404 (not 403) so existence is never leaked.

**Authentication:** send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where `<token>` is either a JWT (interactive login) or an API token (`ts_…` prefix, SHA-256 hashed). API-token callers can't call the token management endpoints themselves — those require a JWT session.

**Error responses** use stable machine keys, not English prose. Every error is returned as `{ "error": "UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_KEY" }` (e.g. `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`, `RUN_REQUIRES_CASES`). Validation errors add a `details` object: `{ "error": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "details": { "formErrors": [], "fieldErrors": { ... } } }`. Clients should match on these keys, not on human-readable text.

## Security notes

### Authentication

- **JWTs** are signed with `JWT_SECRET`. The API refuses to start when `NODE_ENV=production` and `JWT_SECRET` is unset or equal to the default placeholder — use `openssl rand -hex 48` to generate a strong value.
- **API tokens** (`ts_…` prefix) are stored as SHA-256 hashes — a compromised database row can't be used to impersonate the caller. Plaintext is shown exactly once at creation.
- **Token management endpoints require a JWT session** — API-token callers can't mint, list, or revoke tokens, so a leaked token can't be used to create fresh credentials.
- **Email verification** — new signups cannot log in until they verify their email via a tokenized link (24 h TTL, SHA-256 hashed at rest, single-use). Invited, SAML, and SCIM users are auto-verified. Resend is rate-limited and the response is identical for known/unknown emails.
- **Two-factor authentication** — optional TOTP (RFC 6238). The secret is stored per-user; `totpEnabledAt` is `null` until setup is confirmed with a valid code. Login returns a short-lived challenge JWT (5 min) instead of a session when 2FA is active; the full session JWT is only issued after the TOTP code is verified. Disabling 2FA requires the current password.
- **Trusted devices** — when a user checks "Trust this device" during 2FA, an opaque token (`td_` prefix, 256-bit, SHA-256 hashed at rest, 30-day server-side expiry) is issued. On subsequent logins the token is sent via `X-Trust-Token` and validated against `TrustedDevice.tokenHash` + `userId` + `expiresAt`. The token only bypasses the 2FA step — the user's password is still verified. Tokens are revoked on password change, password reset, or 2FA disable; logout does not revoke them.
- **Remember me** — controls JWT lifespan: unchecked = 24 h, checked = 30 d. The flag is forwarded through the 2FA challenge so the session duration is honoured end-to-end.
- **Password reset** wipes the door on both sides: every outstanding JWT for that user is revoked (via `passwordUpdatedAt` compared against the JWT's `iat`), every API token is deleted, and every trusted device token is revoked. If a password leaks, a single reset kicks everyone off the account.
- **Login is timing-neutral** — bcrypt runs even when the email is unknown so response latency can't be used to enumerate accounts.
- **Client error pipeline** (`POST /_client-log`) is **unauthenticated by design** — browsers can't send JWTs on `navigator.sendBeacon`. It's rate-limited per IP, body-capped, and zod-validated. Identity fields (`userId`, `userEmail`, `sessionId`) are **client-asserted and never used for authorization** — only for correlating client errors to backend traces. Authz still lives on the JWT-protected `/api/*` routes.

### Rate limiting

All credential-adjacent endpoints are rate-limited per IP:

| Endpoint              | Window | Max requests |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `POST /auth/login`    | 1 min  | 10           |
| `POST /auth/signup`   | 1 hour | 5            |
| `POST /auth/forgot`   | 1 hour | 5            |
| `POST /auth/reset`    | 1 min  | 10           |
| `POST /auth/invite`   | 1 hour | 30           |
| `GET /auth/invite/:t` | 1 min  | 30           |
| `POST /auth/accept-invite` | 1 min | 10      |
| `POST /auth/verify-email`  | 1 min  | 10           |
| `POST /auth/resend-verification` | 1 hour | 5     |
| `POST /2fa/setup`          | 1 min  | 10           |
| `POST /2fa/confirm-setup`  | 1 min  | 10           |
| `POST /2fa/disable`        | 1 min  | 10           |
| `POST /2fa/authenticate`   | 1 min  | 10           |

When deployed behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY` (e.g. `1` for a single hop) so limits key off the real client IP instead of the proxy.

### Password policy

Applied on signup, password reset, and invite-accept:

- Minimum 10 characters, maximum 128.
- Rejects a small list of common passwords (`password`, `12345678`, `qwerty`, `admin123`, etc).
- Login does not re-validate strength, so pre-policy accounts keep working until their next reset.

### CORS

Set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of origins the browser may call from (scheme + host + port). In development, an empty list auto-reflects the request's Origin; in production, an empty list denies all cross-origin requests.

### Other

- **Reset / invite tokens** are cryptographically random 192-bit values, SHA-256 hashed at rest, and single-use. Raw tokens are never logged — only the token row ID is.
- **`devToken` field** in `/auth/forgot`, `/auth/invite`, `/auth/signup`, and `/auth/resend-verification` responses is only populated when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`, so the plaintext never leaks in prod even if the UI would still render it.
- **Expired `PasswordResetToken` and `InviteToken` rows** are swept every 6 hours by a background task (`backend/src/lib/cleanup.ts`), so the tables don't grow unbounded.
- **Attachments** are stored privately in MinIO; downloads go through signed URLs served by `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`.
- **`.env`** is gitignored by default. Never commit a populated `.env` or `seed.hapster.ts`.
- **All multi-tenant reads** are scoped by `companyId` at the query level (see `backend/src/middleware/scope.ts`). Cross-tenant lookups return 404 (not 403) so existence isn't leaked.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to resolve import @dnd-kit/core"** — run `docker compose up -d --build web`. The web image bakes `node_modules` at build time; adding a dependency requires rebuilding.
- **Browser can't reach the API from another device** — set `VITE_API_URL` to your host's LAN IP (not `localhost`) and rebuild the web container.
- **Signed download URLs fail** — `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` must be the URL the **browser** can hit (host IP + `MINIO_HOST_PORT`), not the in-Docker MinIO address.
- **Port already in use** — override the corresponding `*_HOST_PORT` in `.env`.
- **Seed did nothing on a fresh DB** — check `docker compose logs api | grep Seed`. Every seed step logs either "created" or "skipping".

## Webhooks

Each project can register outbound webhooks under **Project Settings → Webhooks**. Supported events:

| Event                  | Fires when                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run.created`          | a test run is created                                                  |
| `run.completed`        | a test run's status is set to `COMPLETED`                              |
| `run.archived`         | a test run is archived                                                 |
| `execution.passed`     | an execution transitions to `PASSED`                                   |
| `execution.failed`     | an execution transitions to `FAILED`                                   |
| `jira.bug_created`     | a Jira bug is auto-filed for a failed execution                        |

Request body:

```json
{
  "event": "execution.failed",
  "projectId": "…",
  "deliveredAt": "2026-04-15T09:00:00.000Z",
  "data": { "executionId": "…", "runId": "…", "caseId": "…", "...": "..." }
}
```

If a signing secret is configured, every request carries
`x-testsuits-signature: <hex>` where `<hex>` is `HMAC-SHA256(secret, rawBody)`.
Every delivery is recorded (status + error) and shown on the webhook row. Use
the **test** button to fire a sample payload at any time.

## Roadmap

- SSO end-to-end against a real IdP — schema, admin UI, and the SP-initiated `/login` + `/acs` routes are shipped; the remaining gap is wiring `@node-saml/node-saml` into [backend/src/routes/saml.ts](backend/src/routes/saml.ts) to verify SAML assertions against the stored x509 cert
- SCIM groups / role-to-group mapping (Users work today)
- Playwright / Cypress reporter packages
- Traceability matrix report
- Test case versioning / history diff
